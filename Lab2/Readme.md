## ‚úÖ Checkpoint ‚Äì 1 : Caesar Cipher

- **Writing a program to decipher a text has been created using the Caesar cipher.**

```python
# Define the alphabets that we will use for the Caesar cipher
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

def decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, key):
    # Initialize the plaintext as an empty string
    plaintext = ""

    # Loop over each character in the ciphertext
    for char in ciphertext:
        # Convert the character to lowercase
        char = char.lower()

        # If the character is not in the alphabet, add it to the plaintext as is
        if char not in alphabet:
            plaintext += char
        else:
            # Find the index of the character in the alphabet
            index = alphabet.find(char)

            # Subtract the key from the index to decrypt
            new_index = index - key

            # If the new index is negative, wrap around to the end of the alphabet
            if new_index < 0:
                new_index += 26

            # Add the decrypted character to the plaintext
            plaintext += alphabet[new_index]

    # Return the decrypted text
    return plaintext

# Define the ciphertext and key
ciphertext = "odroboewscdrolocdcwkbdmyxdbkmdzvkdpybwyeddrobo"
key = 1

# Decrypt the ciphertext and print the result
print(decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, key))

# Decrypt the ciphertext and print the result for all key 1- 16
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    for k in range(1,26):
        decrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext,k)
        f.write(f"key: {k} decrypted_text: {decrypted_text}\n\n")
```

- Output Code :

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint ‚Äì 2 : A Substitution Cipher

![alt text](./Checkpoint%20-%202/image.png)

- Writing a program to decipher each of the text that has been created using a substitution cipher.

```python
from collections import namedtuple
from operator import attrgetter

CharFreq = namedtuple('CharFreq', 'ch cnt per')

def char_substitution(prev, cur, message):
    return message.replace(prev, cur)

def main():

        cipher = f.read().strip()

    n = len(cipher)

    frequency = [0]*27
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if 'a' <= cipher[i] <= 'z':
            idx = ord(cipher[i]) - ord('a')
            frequency[idx] += 1
            cnt += 1

    y = float(cnt)

    char_frequency = []
    for i in range(26):
        ch = chr(ord('a') + i)
        x = float(frequency[i])
        per = (x / y) * 100.0
        char_frequency.append(CharFreq(ch, frequency[i], per))

    print("---------")
    char_frequency.sort(key=attrgetter('per'), reverse=True)
    for i in range(26):
        ch = char_frequency[i].ch
        freq = char_frequency[i].cnt
        per = char_frequency[i].per

        print(ch, freq, per)

    print("---------")
    message = cipher

    with open('substitutions.txt', 'r') as f:
        substitutions = [tuple(line.strip().split()) for line in f]

IN A PARTICULAR AND, IN EACH CASE, DIFFERENT WAY, THESE FOUR WERE INDISPENSABLE TO HIMYUGO AMARYL, BECAUSE OF HIS QUICK UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOHISTORY AND OF HIS IMAGINATIVE PROBINGS INTO NEW AREAS. IT WAS COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO SELDON HIMSELF BEFORE THE MATHEMATICS OF THE FIELD COULD BE COMPLETELY WORKED OUTAND HOW SLOWLY IT PROCEEDED, AND HOW MOUNTAINOUS THE OBSTACLESTHERE WOULD AT LEAST REMAIN ONE GOOD MIND THAT WOULD CONTINUE THE RESEARCH

BILBO WAS VERY RICH AND VERY PECULIAR, AND HAD BEEN THE WONDER OF THE SHIRE FOR SIXTY YEARS, EVER SINCE HIS REMARKABLE DISAPPEARANCE AND UNEXPECTED RETURN. THE RICHES HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS TRAVELS HAD NOW BECOME A LOCAL LEGEND, AND IT WAS POPULARLY BELIEVED, WHATEVER THE OLD FOLK MIGHT SAY, THAT THE HILL AT BAG END WAS FULL OF TUNNELS STUFFED WITH TREASURE. AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR FAME, THERE WAS ALSO HIS PROLONGED VIGOUR TO MARVEL AT. TIME WORE ON, BUT IT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MR. BAGGINS. AT NINETY HE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS AT FIFTY. AT NINETY-NINE THEY BEGAN TO CALL HIM WELL-PRESERVED; BUT UNCHANGED WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARER THE MARK. THERE WERE SOME THAT SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT THIS WAS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING; IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT ANYONE SHOULD POSSESS (APPARENTLY) PERPETUAL YOUTH AS WELL AS (REPUTEDLY) INEXHAUSTIBLE WEALTH. IT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID FOR, THEY SAID. IT ISN'T NATURAL, AND TROUBLE WILL COME OF IT! BUT SO FAR TROUBLE HAD NOT COME; AND AS MR. BAGGINS WAS GENEROUS WITH HIS MONEY, MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE HIM HIS ODDITIES AND HIS GOOD FORTUNE. HE REMAINED ON VISITING TERMS WITH HIS RELATIVES (EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THE SACKVILLE√Ø¬ø¬ΩBAGGINSES), AND HE HAD MANY DEVOTED ADMIRERS AMONG THE HOBBITS OF POOR AND UNIMPORTANT FAMILIES. BUT HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS, UNTIL SOME OF HIS YOUNGER COUSINS BEGAN TO GROW UP. THE ELDEST OF THESE, AND BILBO'S FAVOURITE, WAS YOUNG FRODO BAGGINS. WHEN BILBO WAS NINETY-NINE HE ADOPTED FRODO AS HIS HEIR, AND BROUGHT HIM TO LIVE AT BAG END; AND THE HOPES OF THE SACKVILLE- BAGGINSES WERE FINALLY DASHED. BILBO AND FRODO HAPPENED TO HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY, SEPTEMBER 22ND. YOU HAD BETTER COME AND LIVE HERE, FRODO MY LAD, SAID BILBO ONE DAY; AND THEN WE CAN CELEBRATE OUR BIRTHDAY-PARTIES COMFORTABLY TOGETHER. AT THAT TIME FRODO WAS STILL IN HIS TWEENS, AS THE HOBBITS CALLED THE IRRESPONSIBLE TWENTIES BETWEEN CHILDHOOD AND COMING OF AGE AT THIRTY-THREE

#### ‚ùì Question : Which input was easier to break? Explain why.

- The Input - 2 was easier to break because the frequency of the characters in the cipher text was more evenly distributed. The frequency of the characters in the cipher text of Input - 1 was more skewed, which made it harder to break.
