      "BILBO WAS VERY RICH AND VERY PECULIAR, AND HAD BEEN THE WONDER OF THE SHIRE FOR SIXTY YEARS, EVER SINCE HIS REMARKABLE DISAPPEARANCE AND UNEXPECTED RETURN. THE RICHES HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS TRAVELS HAD NOW BECOME A LOCAL LEGEND, AND IT WAS POPULARLY BELIEVED, WHATEVER THE OLD FOLK MIGHT SAY, THAT THE HILL AT BAG END WAS FULL OF TUNNELS STUFFED WITH TREASURE. AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR FAME, THERE WAS ALSO HIS PROLONGED VIGOUR TO MARVEL AT. TIME WORE ON, BUT IT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MR. BAGGINS. AT NINETY HE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS AT FIFTY. AT NINETY-NINE THEY BEGAN TO CALL HIM WELL-PRESERVED; BUT UNCHANGED WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARER THE MARK. THERE WERE SOME THAT SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT THIS WAS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING; IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT ANYONE SHOULD POSSESS (APPARENTLY) PERPETUAL YOUTH AS WELL AS (REPUTEDLY) INEXHAUSTIBLE WEALTH. IT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID FOR, THEY SAID. IT ISN'T NATURAL, AND TROUBLE WILL COME OF IT! BUT SO FAR TROUBLE HAD NOT COME; AND AS MR. BAGGINS WAS GENEROUS WITH HIS MONEY, MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE HIM HIS ODDITIES AND HIS GOOD FORTUNE. HE REMAINED ON VISITING TERMS WITH HIS RELATIVES (EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THE SACKVILLEï¿½BAGGINSES), AND HE HAD MANY DEVOTED ADMIRERS AMONG THE HOBBITS OF POOR AND UNIMPORTANT FAMILIES. BUT HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS, UNTIL SOME OF HIS YOUNGER COUSINS BEGAN TO GROW UP. THE ELDEST OF THESE, AND BILBO'S FAVOURITE, WAS YOUNG FRODO BAGGINS. WHEN BILBO WAS NINETY-NINE HE ADOPTED FRODO AS HIS HEIR, AND BROUGHT HIM TO LIVE AT BAG END; AND THE HOPES OF THE SACKVILLE- BAGGINSES WERE FINALLY DASHED. BILBO AND FRODO HAPPENED TO HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY, SEPTEMBER 22ND. YOU HAD BETTER COME AND LIVE HERE, FRODO MY LAD, SAID BILBO ONE DAY; AND THEN WE CAN CELEBRATE OUR BIRTHDAY-PARTIES COMFORTABLY TOGETHER. AT THAT TIME FRODO WAS STILL IN HIS TWEENS, AS THE HOBBITS CALLED THE IRRESPONSIBLE TWENTIES BETWEEN CHILDHOOD AND COMING OF AGE AT THIRTY-THREE\n"
