## Task ‚Äì 3: Encryption mode ‚Äì Corrupted Cipher Text

#### ‚ùì Question : How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively?

- **ECB Mode Recovery**: In ECB mode, each block of plaintext is encrypted independently of other blocks. This means that if a single block is corrupted, only that specific block can be decrypted without affecting the others. Therefore, you can recover the entire file except for the corrupted block.

- **CBC Mode Recovery**: CBC mode uses an IV (Initialization Vector) and chains the encryption of each block to the previous one. If a block is corrupted, it cannot be decrypted without the corresponding ciphertext block. However, if you have the corrupted ciphertext block and the IV, you can decrypt the entire file except for the corrupted block.

- **CFB Mode Recovery**: Similar to CBC, CFB also chains the encryption of each block to the previous one. The difference lies in how the chaining is done. If a block is corrupted, it cannot be decrypted without the corresponding ciphertext block. Recovery depends on having the corrupted ciphertext block and the IV.

- **OFB Mode Recovery**: OFB mode generates a keystream block by block and XORs it with the plaintext block to produce the ciphertext. If a block is corrupted, it cannot be decrypted without the corresponding ciphertext block. Recovery depends on having the corrupted ciphertext block and the IV.

#### ‚ùì Question : Why These Differences?

The differences in recovery capabilities stem from how each mode processes and encrypts data:

1. ECB treats each block as independent, making it easier to recover data but less secure against patterns in the plaintext.
2. CBC, CFB, and OFB all introduce some form of chaining or feedback mechanism, which makes them more secure against patterns but also complicates recovery from corrupted blocks because they depend on the integrity of the entire chain.

#### ‚ùì Question : What are the implications of these differences?

1. ECB (Electronic Codebook): This method has a weakness in that it is susceptible to plaintext patterns and does not effectively diffuse information.
2. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): This technique offers improved diffusion and is more resistant to attacks that utilize known plaintext, compared to ECB.
3. CFB (Cipher Feedback) and OFB (Output Feedback): These modes have the benefit of error propagation, which means that a corruption in one block does not affect the following blocks. This feature can be beneficial in certain situations.

```

![alt text](./assets/image-18.png)

#### Analyze the Results

After running the commands, have encrypted and decrypted files for each mode. Compare the sizes of the original plaintext file and the decrypted files. Observe that the decrypted files are the same size as the original plaintext file, indicating that padding was correctly applied and removed in CBC and CFB modes. In ECB and OFB modes, the sizes may differ due to the nature of these modes, but ECB does not require padding, and OFB does not require padding either.

#### Report Findings

- ECB: No padding is required because it operates on blocks directly.
- CBC: Requires padding because it operates on blocks, and the plaintext length might not match the block size.
- CFB: Requires padding because it operates on blocks of data.
- OFB: Does not require padding because it treats the encryption process as a - stream cipher.

```

1. ‚úÖ Generating the hash value for a file using the **`SHA-256` one-way hash algorithm.**

```bash

## Task ‚Äì 6: Keyed hash and HMAC

- Using OpenSSL to generate keyed hashes for the created file using HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA256, and HMAC-SHA1 algorithms.
- Using different keys of varying lengths for each algorithm.

1. **For `HMAC-MD5`, use a key of 128 bits.**

```bash
openssl dgst -md5 -hmac "mykey" plain.txt
```

2. **For `HMAC-SHA256`, use a key of 256 bits.**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "mylongerkey" plain.txt
```

3. **For `HMAC-SHA1`, use a key of 160 bits.**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac "myshort" plain.txt
```

![alt text](./assets/image-20.png)

#### üîñ Addressing the Key Size Requirement

1. **Fixed Size Requirement:**

**HMAC does not require a fixed key size**. The key can be of any length. However, the choice of key length can affect the security of the HMAC. Longer keys generally offer better security against brute-force attacks.

2. **Key Length Recommendation:**

While there's no strict rule, a common recommendation is to use a key that **is at least as long as the output of the hash function**. For MD5, this is 128 bits, for SHA-256, it's 256 bits, and for SHA-1, it's 160 bits. However, using a longer key is always safer.
