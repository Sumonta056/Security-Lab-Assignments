Hlw ! I am Sumonta Saha Mridul. This is a sceret Message !
I am doing encryption mode in corrupted cipher text..
Checking what happens i modify some code in decription

```

1. Encrypt the file using AES encryption in ECB mode && Cipher Type `-aes-128-ecb`

```bash
    openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -e -in plain.txt -out cipher1.bin -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff
```

- Lets See Inside the Encrypted File

```bash
    cat cipher1.bin
```

- Now Open the encrpted File in Ghex

```bash
    ghex cipher1.bin
```

- Now modify the `30th byte` from `C` to `2`

- Now Decrypt the file using AES encryption in ECB mode && Cipher Type `-aes-128-ecb`

```bash
    openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -d -in cipher1.bin -out decipher1.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff
```

```bash
    cat decipher1.txt
```

- Lets Look the Decrypted File

```bash
    cat decipher1.txt
```

- Here we can see that the `30th byte` is corrupted and the message is not decrypted properly.

2. Encrypt the file using AES encryption in CBC mode && Cipher Type `-aes-128-cbc`

```bash
    openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in plain.txt -out cipher2.bin -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 01020304050607080550101410114501
```

- Lets See Inside the Encrypted File

```bash
    cat cipher2.bin
```

- Now Open the encrpted File in Ghex

```bash
    ghex cipher2.bin
```

![alt text](image-16.png)

- Now modify the `30th byte` from `1` to `3`

- Now Decrypt the file using AES encryption in ECB mode && Cipher Type `-aes-128-cbc`

```bash
    openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in cipher2.bin -out decipher2.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 01020304050607080550101410114501
```

- Lets Look the Decrypted File

```bash
    cat decipher2.txt
```
